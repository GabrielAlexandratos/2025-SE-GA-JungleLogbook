# expense-tracker

This is a short unit to familiarise stage 6 students in NSW to the full software development lifecycle. This demonstration can be presented in class as a guided exercise that is teacher lead. There is an associated activity that can be found [here](https://github.com/yourusername/activity) that students can build themselves to practice their skills and get familiar with the tools and technologies that can be used in software development.

Each step of the implementation is a separate branch to allow you to see the changes in isolation. If you are following the instructions you can also use these branches to verify that your code is correct.

## Supporting Documents
Teachers can also refer to the [SDLC Guide](https://mr-bev.github.io/software-engineering-stage6-nsw/principles/sdlc/) for more information on how to guide students through each stage of the SDLC. 

## Need Help?

Students should talk with their teacher if they encounter any issues or have questions. Teachers and students can also raise issues on the GitHub repository and I will try to respond in a timely manner.

## Acknowledgements

Several websites have been used as resources for this project. As a student you are not expected to read these for the HSC. These sites can be used to deepen your understanding of python, flask, and sqlite. The resources are provided for your reference only.

AI has also been used in the development of this project, particularly `qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct` and `Llama 3.1 8B` running locally. It has been used to generate some of the initial code snippets and provide examples on how to implement certain features. In all cases the output has been validated and corrected for mistakes and to ensure that the code is functional.
