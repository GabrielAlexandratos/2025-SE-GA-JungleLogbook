# Maintenance

During the maintenance phase, we would focus on fixing bugs and improving the system based on user feedback. We would also update the documentation and make sure that all of the code is up-to-date with the latest standards and best practices.

If this was a project following the waterfall model, we would need to complete all of the requirements documented before moving to the maintenance phase. Then during the maintenance phase we would be fixing bugs but not adding new features unless a new waterfall process was started. 

However, since we are using an agile methodology, we can start maintenance as soon as the first iteration is completed. The benefit of using an agile methodology for maintenance is that it allows us to respond quickly to changes in requirements or user feedback. This can help us deliver a more reliable and user-friendly system over time. A drawback can be that the project may never finish if we keep adding new features and fixing bugs indefinitely.
